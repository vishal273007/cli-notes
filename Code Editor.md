# VS Code Settings

`vscode.dev/(link)` - VS Code web editor. [`Source Control` > Enter message > Click on `Commit & Push`]

## Open VS Code in Linux/Windows

- `code .` - VS Code/Cursor in current directory by default. `cursor .` may ask to open current directory again in WSL file system.
- `code filename.txt` - Open file with VS Code

### Tips

- Hold "Alt" key - multi-line cursor.
- Ctrl + alt + up/down - multiple cursor.
- Move cursor to a word with multiple occurrences > "ctrl + d" to make multiple cursor for that word.
- editor: format on save : off - to disable auto formatting on save from settings.
- Use down arrow for code collapse and expand to hide and show a code method block to make the code look absolutely shorter.
- Alt + Shift + O = import java packages automatically in vs code ( like ctrl + shift + o in eclipse)
- Right click on navigation > hide recommended extensions.

### Files and Folders Organization

- Organizing files and folders:

### Folder expand only after clicking the arrow left to the folder

- CTRL + , > search "compact folders" > disable.

### Prevent unwanted folders from getting pushed

- Create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory

## Live Server Setup

### Installation & Usage

1. Install **Node.js**
   - Verify installation by running:

     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. Install live-server globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g live-server
   ```

3. Start the server:
   - Navigate to desired folder
   - Run `live-server` in terminal

### Remote Device Access

- Access via: `http://192.168.0.125:8080`
- **Firewall Configuration:**
  1. Open Firewall → Advanced settings
  2. Navigate to Inbound Rules → Port
  3. Allow connection on port 8080
  4. Name the rule "Allow live-server"

### Prevent cursor to go to the start of the line

- Search `editor.formatontype` - check it to disable auto formatting.
- Search `editor.trimautowhitespace` - uncheck it to trim whitespaces.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Cursor

- Install `cursor` (not `code .`) after installation.

## Cursor Shortcuts

- Ctrl + K = `Toggle inline / Terminal prompt bar` (Open command palette/AI command bar)
- Ctrl + L = `Ask(Open Chat) / Add selection to new chat`
- Ctrl + I = Agent(Composer{code generation}) - Opens the AI code generation in Chat. Used for generating new code or modifying existing code

- `Tab` = Accept suggestion
- `Ctrt + ->` = Accept next word

### Cursor Tips

- Enable `remember my preference` when using search web in cursor for chat.
- Use `Ctrl+K` for learning and assistant while coding. i.e. select one or whole lines of code and ask to add comments or change.
- Use `Context` like web or files options for more controlled assistance.

### Cursor Settings

- Change left Activity Bar orientation panel: `Ctrl + ,` > search "activity bar orientation" > Vertical.

- Change terminal shell to powershell: `Ctrl + ,` > search "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile" > change to "PowerShell".

- Well, it's all over. Now recreating account by deleting account to get free credits. Use the feature while the services are new till they are showing generosity to users, because they will soon implement the security to prevent free usage abuse.

- Delete account and re-login or Use `temp-mail` to check if credit resets. Developers know about free usage abuse. They will implement the security as people get used to using cursor.

- Cursor settings > import settings to copy VS Code settings.

___

### Windsurf

- Customize files in system folders: Open AI code editor as Administrator and do required edits with prompt.
- auto execution policy - `turbo`  to auto run commands.
- in windsurf, when running any command automatically, click on show/run command on the top right corner of command. then click on delete button on the main command line so it will automatically continue running.

- See free Credits usage: Windsurf - Settings at bottom right corner of chat window > Plan Info tab at bottom-left corner of the popup.

- Use `Ctrl + I` for AI code generation and `Ctrl + L`  for AI chat.

- Do not use the AI chat for long editing, instead use it for debugging and learning.

- As Cursor has been completely blocked, now stick with `Windsurf` for tiny credits and free low capable AI Assistant.

- Now use `Windsurf` with less free credits. Cursor, no longer usable for free users.

- Remember that AI editors with models like Claude, GPT 4o is incredibly impressive and very powerful, but very limited for free usage. So ensure to use it for important and complex tasks only.

- Now Windsurf gave few free credits with temp mail at 10:20 PM around. Credits was 0, so I opened Windsurf manually in Chrome, then signed out existing account, then created new account then opened Windsurf and logged in again, then it gave few credits.

```text
Cursor Chat:

Ask(question) - Gives knowledge and does not change code directly. if you ask to add comment, it will give you code and you have to click apply to add comment.

Edit(give command) - directly fix or change code without at once. When you ask to add comment, it directly adds the comment.

Agent(give extended command) - Works as a smart programming partner that can handle complex tasks with multiple steps. It combines both Ask and Edit features - can explain things, make code changes, and continue conversation to improve code further. When you ask to add comment, it will explain what it's doing, add the comment, and might suggest related improvements.
